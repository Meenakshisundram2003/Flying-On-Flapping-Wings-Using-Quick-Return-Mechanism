# Flying-On-Flapping-Wings-Using-Quick-Return-Mechanism
Improved the efficiency of flight in flying objects by replicating the quick wing movements observed in birds. Applied the principles of mechanics to model and simulate the quick return mechanism operating MATLAB and ADAMS simulation software, deployed a prototype using dynamic toolkit. Analyzed the ratio of power stroke to return stroke was 1:2, resulting in a faster return stroke, improving flight performances and maneuverability.
